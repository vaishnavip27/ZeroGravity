    { question: "Beyond Earth's pull", answer: "Zero gravity creates true weightlessness, a state where objects and humans float freely. This phenomenon occurs in space stations and specialized aircraft during parabolic flights, where the pull of gravity is perfectly counteracted by constant free fall" },
    { question: "Body in Space", answer: "The human body undergoes remarkable changes in zero gravity. Astronauts experience temporary height increase as their spine elongates, muscle and bone mass begin to decrease, and bodily fluids shift upward. These changes require special exercise routines and medical monitoring.." },
    { question: "Future Horizons", answer: "Zero gravity environments enable groundbreaking research in medicine, materials, and space technology. Scientists conduct experiments impossible on Earth, leading to innovations in manufacturing, medicine, and preparing humanity for long-duration space missions to Mars and beyond." },
